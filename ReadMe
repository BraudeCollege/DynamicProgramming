The solutions iterates through each of the possible combination of gates with the given inputs and retrieves the optimal solution recursively. For n arrival times, the given combinations can be n-1 ways. For instance, if the given arrival times are 4 in number (ABCD), then there are 3 ways to form gates: A(BCD), (AB)CD and (ABC)D. So we divide the problem into sub problems of smaller size. Therefore, the problem has optimal substructure property and is solved using Dynamic Programming.
